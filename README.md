# Handwritten Digits Recognition
This project compares the performance of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using the MNIST dataset.
Both models are implemented in python, and can be tested with the GUI.

## Models

### Multilayer Perceptron
The MLP is a type of neural network that consists of multiple layers of neurons, each connected to all neurons in the next layer. It uses a backpropagation algorithm to adjust weights and minimize the error.

### Convolutional Neural Network
The CNN is a type of neural network designed to process and classify images. It uses convolutional layers to extract features from images and pooling layers to reduce dimensionality.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the required libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, just execute src/main.py from the project directory to test the models with the GUI.
